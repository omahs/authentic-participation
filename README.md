Principles of Authentic Participation: Guidelines on how organizations and individuals can contribute authentically to open source projects and communities


## About

This repository is a working draft of the _Principles of Authentic Participation_.
This is one place to continue the conversation from Sustain 2020 and to create a resource we can take back to our organizations to advocate for authentic contributions in open source communities.
For more background context, see the [Sustain OSS Discourse discussion thread](https://discourse.sustainoss.org/t/principles-of-authentic-participation-continuing-the-sustain-conversation/284).

**Purpose**: To define a core set of principles of what authentic participation means in multiple contexts (e.g. corporate, individual, humanitarian/NGO, etc.).
